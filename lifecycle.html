					<h3>Eggs</h3>
					<h4>Female Stag Beetles lay an average of 24 eggs, depositing them underground near rotting wood.
					</h4>
					<p>Assuming enough wood remains to support their offspring, females will often return to where they
						emerged to lay. The eggs are tiny – measuring just a few mm long. They will develop for around
						30 days before hatching, at which point a tiny, totally creamy-white larva will emerge. Within a
						few hours of hatching, the larva will develop the distinctive bright orange head that is
						characteristic of Stag Beetle larvae.</p>

					<h3>larvae</h3>
					<h4>The rotting wood near to where it hatched will become the larva’s home for up to the next six
						years.
					</h4>
					<p>It will feed on the wood, and in the soil around it, growing to an eventual size of up to 110mm.
						During the larval phase, the beetle is building up all the fat stores in its body that it will
						use to fuel it for the few short weeks of its adult life.</p>
					<p>
						The larvae have to moult their skin as they grow – they will do this anywhere from 3-5 times
						across the course of their development.

					<h3>Pupa</h3>
					<h4>The rotting wood near to where it hatched will become the larva’s home for up to the next six
						years.
					</h4>
					<p>After 6 years, the larva leaves the wood and makes a cocoon in the soil. Next it turns into a
						pupa. This stage happens in late summer or autumn and lasts a few weeks.</p>
					<p>
						Next the fully grown beetle leaves the cocoon but it stays under the ground until the next
						summer. This photo shows a male pupa with large antlers on top, and a female at the bottom.

					<h3>Adult</h3>
					<h4>Come summer, the beetle will dig its way up to the surface, emerging into daylight for the very
						first time in its life – ready to head out into the world and start the cycle all over again…
					</h4>
					<p>The fully grown male stag beetle flies in
						the evening, looking for a mate. It is up to 75mm long including its antlers. The antlers are
						used for display, fighting and holding the female still when mating. It does not need to eat,
						but it may feed on sap.
